Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a music streaming system where users can not only stream music but also users can create accounts, browse music, follow artists, create playlists, see recently listened tracks. The system will utilize a structured database to manage user data, music metadata, playlists, and interactions between users.
The project features a database that manages data on users, user following interactions, artists, tracks, albums, user interactions(on a particular track), recently listened(for each user), and playlists. We are planning to use JSON on playlist tracks and “following and followed by” data for each user for now. 
Problem Definition
In the current landscape of music streaming, there is a need for a comprehensive platform that not only allows streaming but also enhances user experience through features. The main challenges include managing a large dataset of music tracks, albums, and optimizing performance for real-time interactions.
